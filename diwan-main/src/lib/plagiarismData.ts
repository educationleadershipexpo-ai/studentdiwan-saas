    text: `The proposed system uses soil moisture sensors connected to a microcontroller to monitor field conditions in real time. When the moisture level drops below a configured threshold, the controller activates a water pump through a relay module. Data from the sensors is transmitted to a cloud dashboard over Wi-Fi, allowing farmers to monitor crop health remotely. The architecture reduces water wastage by delivering irrigation only when it is required. Experimental results show a thirty percent reduction in water consumption compared with traditional scheduled irrigation. The system also sends alerts to a mobile application whenever anomalies are detected in the field.`,

    text: `Email spam remains a significant problem for both individuals and organisations. In this project we build a classifier that distinguishes spam from legitimate messages using natural language processing techniques. The dataset is first cleaned by removing stop words and applying stemming to reduce words to their root form. Features are extracted using a term frequency inverse document frequency representation. We compare the performance of naive Bayes, support vector machines, and logistic regression. The support vector machine achieved the highest accuracy of ninety six percent on the held out test set. The model is then deployed as a lightweight web service that scores incoming messages in real time.`,

    text: `This report presents the design of an autonomous street lighting system powered entirely by solar energy. During the day a photovoltaic panel charges a battery through a charge controller that prevents overcharging. At dusk a light dependent resistor detects the fall in ambient light and switches on energy efficient LED lamps. A motion sensor dims the lights when no activity is present, conserving stored energy. The system eliminates dependence on the electrical grid and reduces operational costs for municipalities. Field testing over three months demonstrated reliable operation even during cloudy weather.`,
